## TODO

* ~~Render a sine wave in two.js~~

* ~~Add controls to change frequency and amplitude~~

* ~~Draw subtick marks~~

* Draw labels on the grid

* Change the sine wave in time using an animation

  * Play and pause buttons

* ~~Show time axis~~

* ~~Allow change of phase angle~~

  * ~~Display phase angle along with time delay (phase angle / (2 * pi * freq))~~

  * ~~Show both unshifted and shifted waveforms~~


* ~~Show equation on page in LaTeX~~

* ~~Make frequency and amplitude inputs use LaTeX~~
